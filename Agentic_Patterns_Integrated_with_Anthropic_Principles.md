# Agentic Patterns ‚Äì Integrated with Anthropic Principles

This document combines a taxonomy of **common agentic design patterns** with guidance from Anthropic‚Äôs [*Building Effective Agents*](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents). Together, they provide a clearer picture of how to design and reason about AI agents effectively.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Workflows vs. Agents

Anthropic emphasizes an important distinction:

- **Workflows** ‚Äì Linear, predefined processes (e.g., prompt chaining, routing, orchestrated steps).
- **Agents** ‚Äì Systems where an LLM **decides dynamically** how to act, which tools to use, and when to stop.

üëâ Many real-world systems blend these two approaches. Workflows offer structure, while agentic autonomy adds flexibility.

## üîë Core Agentic Patterns

### 1. ReAct (Reason + Act)
- **Idea:** Agent alternates between reasoning steps and tool actions.
- **Why it matters:** Transparent reasoning, effective in tool-augmented tasks.
- **Anthropic Link:** Core part of the *augmented LLM* model.

---

### 2. Reflection / Self-Correction
- **Idea:** Agent critiques and improves its own output (Reflexion loops).
- **Why it matters:** Boosts reliability, reduces hallucinations.
- **Anthropic Link:** Fits within iterative workflow designs that favor refinement.

---

### 3. Planning + Execution
- **Idea:** Agent decomposes a problem into sub-tasks (plan) and then executes them.
- **Why it matters:** Reduces token waste, enforces structure on complex tasks.
- **Anthropic Link:** Equivalent to **prompt chaining** workflows.

---

### 4. Tool Use / Function Calling
- **Idea:** Agents invoke APIs, search tools, databases, or actuators.
- **Why it matters:** Enables agents to take action beyond text generation.
- **Anthropic Link:** Anchored in the **augmented LLM** (tools, retrieval, code execution, files, caching).
- **Note:** The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is emerging as a standard for tool integration.

---

### 5. Memory-Augmented Agents
- **Idea:** Beyond the context window, agents use:
  - Short-term scratchpads
  - Long-term vector stores
  - Episodic or semantic memory
- **Why it matters:** Provides persistence, personalization, and continuity.
- **Anthropic Link:** Part of augmenting LLMs to extend their effective context.

---

### 6. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Idea:** Specialized agents (Planner, Researcher, Critic, Synthesizer) interact.
- **Why it matters:** Mirrors human teamwork; allows parallelization.
- **Anthropic Example:** *Orchestrator‚Äìworker* architecture in Anthropic‚Äôs Research system.
  - Orchestrator spawns subagents in parallel.
  - Subagents gather/search/summarize independently.
  - Orchestrator synthesizes and iterates.
- **Trade-offs:** Richer reasoning, but higher latency and cost.

---

## üß© Secondary / Emerging Patterns

- **Hierarchical Agents** ‚Äì Manager delegates to workers (variant of orchestrator‚Äìworker).
- **Simulation / Roleplay Agents** ‚Äì Agents emulate roles or personas (training, synthetic data).
- **Governance / Safety Loops** ‚Äì Critic or reviewer agents filter, enforce policies, or add guardrails.
- **Routing / Parallelization Workflows** ‚Äì As described by Anthropic, workflows can branch or run in parallel to speed up results.
